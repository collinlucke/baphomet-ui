# baphomet-ui

Right now, this is just a simple app that can view and change movie data. But hopes to be, oh, so much more... Actually, it doesn't even do that right now because I tore out everything and started over.

Stay tuned...

Frontend for the [baphomet-server](https://github.com/collinlucke/baphomet-server) project

#### All the things that need done or looked into

- Look in using `<link>` instead of `<PANavLink>`
- Move the whole thing to the `baphy` sub directory
- Replace Login page with modal
- Create model component in `phantomartist`
- Work on styles, both here and in `phantomartist` - better contrast would be nice
- Maybe change the name of `phantomartist`
